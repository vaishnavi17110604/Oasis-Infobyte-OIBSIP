                     <h1> About</h1>

                     <p id="about"><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>; (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015) was an
                            Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the <a>11th president of India
                            </a>from 2002
                            to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly
                            at the
                            Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation
                            (ISRO)
                            and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile
                            development
                            efforts. He thus came
                            to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
                            missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
                            and
                            political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
                            nuclear test
                            by India in 1974.<br>
                            Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                            Bharatiya
                            Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                            "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public
                            service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the
                            Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.<br>
                            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed
                            and died <a>on 27 July 2015</a>, aged 83. Thousands, including
                            national-level
                            dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was
                            buried with full state honours.

                     <h1> Early Life and Education</h1>

                     <p id="life_edu">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim
                            family in
                            the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father
                            was a
                            boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. Kalam was the
                            youngest of
                            four brothers and one sister in his family. The family was poverty-stricken by the time
                            Kalam was
                            born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.<br>
                            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking
                            student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially
                            mathematics.
                            After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram,
                            Kalam went
                            on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of
                            Madras,
                            from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace
                            engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
                            He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in
                            qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.
